# Lesson 10 Changes and Implementation Notes

## Differences between my code and lession/10 branch:

1. API Route Path Structure
   - lession/10 uses `/api/v1/...` path format
   - My code uses `/api/...` path format
   - Note: My current implementation kept as is for consistency

2. Socket.IO Integration
   - lession/10 includes Socket.IO integration for real-time notifications
   - lession/10 emits events like 'user_created' and 'user_updated'
   - Implementation completed: Added Socket.IO server and event emitting in controllers

3. User Controller Features
   - lession/10 has additional controller methods like getAllPaging, updateUser, deleteUser
   - Implementation completed: Added all missing controller methods

   - Implementation completed: Added refresh token and revocation functionality
   - Added getCurrentLoginUser method to get the currently logged-in user information

7. File Structure and Naming
   - Changed file naming from "sever.ts" to "server.ts" to align with conventions
   - Updated package.json script to reference the correct file name

8. Environment Variables
   - Added support for JWT_REFRESH_SECRET and PAGE_SIZE environment variables
   - Updated validateEnv function to include these variables

## Implementation Details:

1. Socket.IO Integration:
   - Installed socket.io package
   - Set up Socket.IO server in App class
   - Implemented connection handling and basic event listeners
   - Updated user controllers to emit events via Socket.IO

2. JWT Authentication Enhancements:
   - Added refresh token generation and validation
   - Implemented token revocation (stub implementation for now)
   - Extended TokenData interface to include refreshToken

3. User Management:
   - Implemented pagination support for user listing
   - Added endpoints for create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations
   - Implemented controllers and service methods for all functionality

4. Server Configuration:
   - Fixed incorrect filename (sever.ts â†’ server.ts)
   - Updated scripts in package.json

## Next Steps:

Future lessons should focus on implementing:
1. Profile module with experience and education tracking
2. Posts module with comments, likes, and sharing functionality
3. Groups module for user communities
4. Conversation module for direct messaging between users
